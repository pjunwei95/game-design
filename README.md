# Mirage - NM3216 Game Design Project

An alternate-dimensional platformer game set in the very depths of Singapore.

# Overview

Mirage is a single-player platformer game.  It features the player, portrayed by Lucy, waking up from her sleep and realises that she is able to drift in and out of the real world and the Afterlife. She has to interact with items and navigate around ghosts concurrently without getting killed, which happens when she meets any angry ghosts. Ultimately, she has to collect broken shards to piece together a mirror, create a portal and leave for the next level. 

Mirage is appealing to players who like games that requires solving puzzles with a fantasy / eerie feel.
